# chess
A Java implementation of the classical chess game.
- Used various built-in Java modules, including: Abstract Window Toolkit, JFrame, etc...
- Implemented various inter-connected modules named, "Board," "Frame," "Game," "Move," and "Piece" that worked together to facilitate the game.
- Built around classical Java programming techniques involving: inheritance, implements, extends, sets, getters & setters, etc.. to make efficient use of existing code.
- Exception Handlers as appropriate.
- Lots of manual calculations (and rigorous testing) in 2D to ensure the pieces moves appropriately.
Disclaimer:I did not develop this program from scratch;I have looked up enough many tutorials and imitated.
